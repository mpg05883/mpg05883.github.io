Hi! I recently graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California (USC).

My research investigates how data can be used more effectively by using data like time series and text to actively guide shape from pre-training to inference and evaluation instead of being passively consumed, and using these methods to service  characteristics like generalizability, explainability, and interpretability.

Towards this, I am currently working with Professor [Yan Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/yanliu-ai/home) on improving generalizability and explainability in **Time Series Foundation Models**. I am also working with Professors [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) and [Yixin Wang](https://yixinwang.github.io/) on improving interpretability in LLM benchmarking.

Here is my [CV](/files/Mike_Gee_CV.pdf).
