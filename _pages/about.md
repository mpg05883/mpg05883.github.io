I recently graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I am working with [Prof. Yan Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/yanliu-ai/home) on **Time Series Foundation Models** and [Prof. Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) with [Prof. Yixin Wang](https://yixinwang.github.io/) from the University of Michigan on **LLM evaluations**.

<!-- My research investigates how data can be used more effectively by using data like time series and text to actively guide shape from pre-training to inference and evaluation instead of being passively consumed, and using these methods to service  characteristics like generalizability, explainability, and interpretability. -->

<!-- Towards this, I am currently working with Professor [Yan Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/yanliu-ai/home) on improving generalizability and explainability in **Time Series Foundation Models**. I am also working with Professors [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) and [Yixin Wang](https://yixinwang.github.io/) on improving interpretability in LLM benchmarking. -->

Here is my [CV](/files/Mike_Gee_CV.pdf).

## News

- **Dec 2025**: [TSOrchestra](https://github.com/DC-research/TSorchestra), an agentic zero-shot forecasting framework I created with [Defu Cao](https://idevede.github.io/), achieved **1st place** on Salesforce's [GIFT-Eval Time Series Forecasting Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/GIFT-Eval)
